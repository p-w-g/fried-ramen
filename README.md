# fried-ramen

Cost tracker slash budget planner, helps with tracking expenses, and planning future expense by labelling and grouping expenses.

I know I should've called this app cup-ramen, because that's what students tend to eat when broke, but meh, felt fancy with frying the noodles afterwards.

## purpose
Stop buying random stuff, start buying useful stuff. Get an overview with montly, yearly or whatever scope I need.

localhost: npm run serve
