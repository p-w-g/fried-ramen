# fried-ramen

Cost tracker slash budget planner. Im having hard time wrapping my head around remembering what stuff I was supposed to pay before next payday, soo if I paid something off Im going to freeze it since its most likely recurring bill. Otherwise I'll have a snapshot of how much I'm spending this month.
